# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.2] - 2026-08-30

### Added

- CPU utilization is now reported on macOS and Windows, so the Performance
  page's CPU Usage tile shows a live figure on every supported platform instead
  of only on Linux. It is read through `host_statistics` on macOS and
  `GetSystemTimes` on Windows, and normalised to the same tick units the panel
  already differences.

### Changed

- Completed the rename to **Lightweight**: the native desktop application — the
  window title, tray, menus, dialogs, and the installer and artifact names —
  now reads "Lightweight" instead of "Hermes", following the panel rename in
  0.1.1.
- Renamed the internal workspace crates from `hermes-*` to `lightweight-*`. The
  `hermes` command and its `HERMES_*` environment variables, the `hermes_*`
  metric names, the `hermes::` log targets, and the existing data directory are
  deliberately unchanged, so nothing that scripts, scrapers, or existing
  installs depend on has moved.

### Fixed

- Long file-path values no longer overflow their cards on the Settings and API
  Gateway pages; they wrap within the card instead.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-26

### Changed

- Renamed the desktop shell to **Lightweight**: the sidebar brand name and the
  window title bar now read "Lightweight" instead of "Hermes".

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-25

### Added

- An OpenAI-compatible, CPU-only inference gateway backed by a supervised
  llama.cpp process.
- GGUF model discovery, verified downloads, imports, and live model switching.
- Conservative RAM admission control with context and KV-cache sizing.
- Benchmarking and machine-scoped calibration with trust checks that reject
  unsafe fits.
- A desktop UI and CLI packages for macOS, Windows, and Linux.

### Known limitations

- Calibration is intentionally deferred for pinned llama.cpp `b10590`:
  `hermes bench --fit` safely refuses every honest fit, so the shipped estimates
  remain conservative by 1.37×–2.85×.
