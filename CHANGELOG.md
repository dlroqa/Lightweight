# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-26

### Changed

- Renamed the desktop shell to **Lightweight**: the sidebar brand name and the
  window title bar now read "Lightweight" instead of "Hermes".

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-25

### Added

- An OpenAI-compatible, CPU-only inference gateway backed by a supervised
  llama.cpp process.
- GGUF model discovery, verified downloads, imports, and live model switching.
- Conservative RAM admission control with context and KV-cache sizing.
- Benchmarking and machine-scoped calibration with trust checks that reject
  unsafe fits.
- A desktop UI and CLI packages for macOS, Windows, and Linux.

### Known limitations

- Calibration is intentionally deferred for pinned llama.cpp `b10590`:
  `hermes bench --fit` safely refuses every honest fit, so the shipped estimates
  remain conservative by 1.37×–2.85×.
